xboard-relay
============

Introduction
------------
This project aims to create a server component written in Python which will control relays on a remote Arduino board (specifically the DF Robot XBoard V3) communicating using ZigBee through XBee Series 2 radios.  This is a learning project so don't use my code for any production work (You have been warned :-))
